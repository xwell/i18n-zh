## 说 明 ##
把回信放这里，不是说我们不要翻译质量了。质量是要的，但也是要每个人量力而行的。当我们已经求过翻译软件，仔细看过 wikipedia，但还是无解时。“质量”的定义，老外给了我们一个好的解释。

It's a good idea to upload files to the robot **as soon as you
yourself are content with them**.  You can always send in a corrected
version of a PO file later if during review someone finds a mistake
or there is simply something you would like to change.  The robot
doesn't mind, and the **upstream maintainer won't mind a few messages
extra when these mean that people are actively working on the
translations**.  So... **better** send them in soon than miss the next
release of a package.  :)
